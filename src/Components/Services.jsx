      <h1 className="s-title">SEA FRIEGHT</h1>
      <p>If you ship in bulk, and need containers and pallets much larger than what air and land freight allow, sea freight will be a better match for your eCommerce shipping requirements. As natural ‘passengers’ for sea freight, think of vehicles, furniture, and large amounts of surplus or secondhand goods. For sellers who don’t struggle with time constraints, it’s also a more economical option.</p>

      <h1 className="s-title">AIR FREIGHT</h1>
      <p>Let’s begin with air freight or air shipping. Of the three choices, it is the shortest, making it the best choice for express deliveries or documents, perishable goods (e.g. prescription and food products), emergency supplies, and high-value consumer products such as electronics.</p>

      <h1 className="s-title">PACKAGING</h1>
      <p>We offer specialised packaging services for your shipments. Our packing services, which range from durable crates and protected cases to efficient pallets, allow the safe and secure shipping of your goods while minimising risks and maximising efficiency.</p>
